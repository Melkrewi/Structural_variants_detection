# Structural_variants_detection
This directory contains the code to perform the following analyses (described in the article: Scheduled release of chromatinâ€“nuclear periphery contact during meiotic chromosome movements preserves genome integrity):
* [Plotting and matching the read length distribution between the two libraries](https://github.com/Melkrewi/Structural_variants_detection/blob/1222ffcdc91b8e14f6de96e2c38bd0ecc455e7be/match_read_length_distribution.md).
* [Structural variant calling using cuteSV and sniffles](https://github.com/Melkrewi/Structural_variants_detection/blob/1222ffcdc91b8e14f6de96e2c38bd0ecc455e7be/Structural_variant_calling.md).
* [Analysis and Interactive plotting](https://github.com/Melkrewi/Structural_variants_detection/blob/e55f6b0b63a9fea9b495d43723c0a2f468f1f2aa/rearrangements_project_interactive_plotting.ipynb). This notebook can be uploaded and used on google colab. Links should be replaced if the files are generated from scratch.

* The VCF files used in the analysis can be downloaded from: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17132048
